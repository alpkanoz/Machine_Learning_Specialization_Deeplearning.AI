## About Course and Certificate
Master fundamental AI concepts and develop practical machine learning skills in the beginner-friendly, 3-course program by AI visionary Andrew Ng.

I builded ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn, builded & trained supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression).

I applied practices for ML development & used unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection.

I builded & trained a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, & build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods.

I builded recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach & a content-based deep learning method & build a deep reinforcement learning model.
